# IMPACTECH_CZ
### Input-output model assessing changes in socioeconomic indicators and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the energy transition with a focus on the Czech Republic

The IMPACTECH_CZ model is a tool for assessing expected changes in labour demand, gross value added, gross domestic product and greenhouse gas emissions associated with technological change in the energy sector. It includes a detailed gross fixed capital formation module and allows the inclusion of explicit assumptions about future technological change for selected renewable energy sources.
