# IMPACTECH_EU

### Input-output model assessing changes in socioeconomic indicators and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the energy transition with a focus on the European Union and the United Kingdom

IMPACTECH_EU is a tool for assessing expected changes in labour demand associated with technological change in the energy sector. It includes a detailed gross fixed capital formation module and allows the inclusion of explicit assumptions about future technological change for selected renewable energy sources.
